# Enhancing-Information-Retrieval-Using-Topic-Modelling
The project aims to enhance information retrieval by integrating CUR decomposition for dimensionality reduction and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling. Combine this with traditional information retrieval systems to offer results that are contextually aligned with the query topics.
